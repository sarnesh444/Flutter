## Objective:

#### As a part of the 30 days of code challenge I wanted to explore different domains so just wanted to check the comfort of working with Flutter.

I found out a simple,easy to get started crash course on youtube from TraverseryMedia check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gDhl4leEzA)

If you are on a windows system with a poor configuration I would totally recommend using VSCode for coding in Dart(Flutter).
